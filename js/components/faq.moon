    <h2>What is HODL?</h2>
    <p>The word comes from an epic drunkpost on the Bitcoin Forum where the guy misspelled "HOLDING" as "HODLING". <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0">Thread</a></p>
    <h2>Why should I HODL?</h2>
    <p>The price of crypto currencies is very volatile. 10% or 20% swings in one day are nothing special.<br />
    If you believe in the idea behind cryptocurrencies, you should not let yourself get stressed over those swings. Because in the long term, the price will most likely go up. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbZ8zDpX2Mg">Relevant Video</a></p>
